#Variable Naming
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

#  1.0  Data Types

#String
greet =  "Hello World"
#To check the data type & display output
print(type(greet))

#Integer
#Try to check the datatype
number = 1

#Float
#Try to check the datatype
float_number = 5.0

#Complex Number
#Try to check the datatype
complex_number = 1+3j

# 1.1 Assigning Operator
x =  5
## What is the value of x? Try to print out and check the results at terminal

# 1.2 Arithmetic Operator
## What is the value of c,d,e,f? Try to print out and check the results at terminal
a = 4
b = 2
c =  a+b
d =  a-b
e =  a*b
d =  a/b

## Try to use other arithmetic operator %, **, // on y&z and check the results at terminal
y = 3
z = 2

## Can we do more advance calculation which involved more than 2 numbers, or different datatype (int & float), try it out!!!
# 1.3 Input data
name = input("Enter Your Name")
age = input("What is your age? ")
## How to accept only int as the format for age?
